Donation Exclusion List
Used Mattresses—due to bio hazard / bed bug concerns.
Chemicals—specialized disposal process (unless it is something we KNOW for SURE that we can use—i.e. select cleaning supplies)
Used Tires—also a specialized disposal process - very expensive to dispose of.
E-Waste Items (non-working electronics/appliances) - we currently DO NOT have the system, manpower, or budget in place to constantly recycle these.
Structurally-Compromised Furniture—we don't want any one getting hurt (personnel/customer) nor expose ourselves to potential lawsuits. However, there are VERY RARE EXCEPTIONS when the item is a repairable antique item (subject to management's approval).
Inflated Items (inflatable beds/pools/etc.)—unless it's one of those inflatable blow-up characters, we do not take these as well since they are USELESS punctured.
Car / Booster Seats—Due to recall issues we can only accept NEW.
Linens / Blankets / Soiled Sleeping Pillows -due to bio hazard / bed bug concerns. We will accept NEW.
Tube TVs—buying market is virtually gone; an expense to recycle.
Wet/Smelly/Damaged/Heavily-Soiled Articles (includes clothes, couches, toys, etc)—should be self-explanatory, but as always, we try to be courteous in explaining to customers WHY turning down their less-than-desirable conditioned items help curb our operating costs (which obviously, in-turn, keeps the shelter doors open).
We also highly recommend donors to place items in clear plastic bags.

It is not a guarantee that your items will be taken at the time it is dropped off. Donations will be at the discretion of the Dock Lead/Associates. Thank you!

O-House Thrift in Vacaville 
reopens with new look
By Kimberly K. Fu, The Reporter News | January 2018

Bargain shoppers and treasure hunters take note — the Opportunity House Thrift Store has reopened. The newly renovated space on Peabody Road is freshly cleaned, painted, organized and open for business as of Tuesday. The store had closed for about a week as staff and supporters briefly took over the facility. "This was all-volunteer," said Sunny Tyler, the store manager. "Everything from the paint to the signs." The remodel, it seems, was a great experience. "They have put their hard work into this," said Tyler of the volunteers. "It was everybody putting up a helping hand."
