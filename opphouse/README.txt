IF YOU'RE TAKING OVER THIS PROJECT:
	Written in Django - python framework for dynamic webpages, plenty of videos on YouTube & stuff to figure out
		MAKE SURE TURN DEBUG=FALSE in settings.py WHEN DEPLOYING

	lots of separate pages/files make things look more complicated than it actually is

	models.py - data classes website uses
	strings.py - document with all text on site, all in one location so easier to change repeated text & includes translations

	any specific questions/problems, talk to V - vsliupas@gmail.com, (707)9990997
